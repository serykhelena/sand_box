This means that each individual edge traversal should be O(1) (and we do k O(1) edge traversals, one for each letter of our word, resulting in a O(k) time complexity overall). However, if we were to store the edges as a list, we would unfortunately have to perform a O(|Σ|) search operation to find a given edge, where |Σ| is the size of our alphabet.\n",

    "To combat this and maintain the O(1) edge traversals, we instead allocate space for all of the edges that can come out of a given node right off the bat in the form of an array. We fill in the slots for edges that we use, and we leave the slots for unused edges empty. This way, if we're at some node u and if we're given some character c, we can find the edge coming out of u that is labeled by c in O(1) time by simply going to the corresponding slot of the array of edges. This O(1) time complexity to find an edge given a character c assumes that we have a way of mapping c to an index in our array of edges in O(1) time, which is a safe assumption. \n",
